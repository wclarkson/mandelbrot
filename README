I was reading about the mathematical definition of the Mandelbrot Set and
decided to implement it myself in Processing. Wikipedia has an interesting
section on technical concerns about generating the Mandelbrot Set, and
specifically on coloring. I have implemented two methods for coloring the
set: the Normalized Iteration Count algorithm and a color mapping based
on the escape time for a point. I also implemented a simple zoom function
allowing the user to examine a section of the set in more detail. The
program works, but there is definitely room for performance optimization.
